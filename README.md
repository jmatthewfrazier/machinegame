# THE MACHINE

A game made entirely in javascript

Prologue:
  They lived in its shadow. “A protector” some would say. Though the mass of pipes and plates had never so much as creaked under its own weight. 

In places it would block out the sun. Farmers learned to harvest in the fleeting daylight. “A force of nature” they called it, “from a different time”

To the children it was “the watcher”.
To the scavengers it was “the supply”.
Though many names it would have, none knew what it was. 
Only that it was older than any man or woman, and more vast than the moon itself.

It sat on the edge of town. A sprinkling of crimson earth would rest on its pipes and in its crevices, almost blending in with the layer of rust that had come to coat the exterior. From a distance one could make out its rectangular shape -- like a tombstone planted in the desert. Scavengers frequented its edges as they were easier to climb.

The monolith stood -- a fixture of the land. Until it awoke. Clouds of gas burst forth from its ancient mouth, melting, burning, maiming the ground below it and anyone foolish enough to trust it. Dark storm clouds billowed into the sky, lightning struck with livid ferocity and an uncanny sense of intention: striking homes, crop fields, and the occasional pack animal. A single ruby-red beacon pierced the caustic fog and behind it emerged the “protector” -- the “force of nature” -- “the watcher” -- “the supply”. Its layer of rust burned off to unveil a brilliant chrome facade. From then on it would know one name -- “The Machine”.
